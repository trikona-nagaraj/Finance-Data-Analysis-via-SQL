## Task 1 - Croma India Gross sales Report: Monthly Product Transactions


This Task focuses on analyzing individual product-level sales for Croma India on a monthly basis for the fiscal year (FY) 2021. By leveraging MySQL, I extracted, transformed, and analyzed data to provide insights into customer transactions, product performance, and financial metrics.


### Task Objectives

- Aggregate monthly sales data for Croma India for FY 2021.
- Retrieve detailed product and variant information for all transactions.
- Calculate gross price totals for transactions by integrating multiple data sources.
- Utilize MySQL User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to simplify fiscal year and quarter calculations.



### Dataset Overview

The analysis uses the following tables:

- fact_sales_monthly: Contains monthly sales transaction data.
- dim_customer: Provides customer details, including codes and names.
- dim_product: Includes product and variant details.
- fact_gross_price: Contains gross price per product for each fiscal year.

### Steps and Queries

Step 1: Exploring Sales Data

I began by inspecting the monthly sales data and identifying relevant customer records for Croma India:


SELECT * FROM fact_sales_monthly;
SELECT * FROM dim_customer WHERE customer LIKE '%Croma%';

Result: Identified the customer code for Croma India: 90002002.


### Step 2: Filtering Sales Data for FY 2021

To filter Croma Indiaâ€™s transactions for FY 2021, we wrote a function to calculate the fiscal year by adding 4 months to the transaction date:


SELECT * FROM fact_sales_monthly 
WHERE customer_code = 90002002 
AND YEAR(DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL 4 MONTH)) = 2021;


Optimization: Created a User-Defined Function (UDF) to simplify fiscal year filtering:

Updated query using UDF:

SELECT * FROM fact_sales_monthly 
WHERE customer_code = 90002002 
AND get_fiscal_year(date) = 2021;
