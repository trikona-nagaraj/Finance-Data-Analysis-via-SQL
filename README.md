Gross Sales Report Product Level (Finance Analytics)



# SQL Task 1: Gross Sales Report Product Level (Finance Analytics)

## Summary

Generate a gross sales report for **Croma India** to track product-level sales aggregated on a monthly basis for FY 2021. This aids stakeholders in analyzing product performance and financial metrics.

---

### Task Objectives
- Aggregate monthly sales for FY 2021.
- Include product and variant details.
- Calculate gross price totals for transactions.
- Use **MySQL User-Defined Functions (UDFs)** for fiscal year and quarter calculations.

---

### Dataset Overview
- **fact_sales_monthly**: Monthly sales data.
- **dim_customer**: Customer details.
- **dim_product**: Product and variant details.
- **fact_gross_price**: Gross price by product for each fiscal year.

### Steps and Queries


#### Step 1: Exploring Sales Data

```sql
SELECT * FROM fact_sales_monthly;
SELECT * FROM dim_customer WHERE customer LIKE '%Croma%';

SELECT * FROM dim_customer WHERE customer LIKE '%Croma%';     -- Identify customer code.

```

Result: Identified the customer code for Croma India: 90002002.

---

#### Step 2: Filtering Sales Data for FY 2021

To filter Croma Indiaâ€™s transactions for FY 2021, I wrote a function
to calculate the fiscal year by adding 4 months to the transaction date:

```sql
SELECT * FROM fact_sales_monthly 
WHERE customer_code = 90002002 
AND YEAR(DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL 4 MONTH)) = 2021;         -- Filter for FY 2021.
```

Optimization: Created a User-Defined Function (UDF) to simplify fiscal year filtering:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION 'get_fiscal_year'(calendar_date date)
  RETURNS integer
  DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
  DECLARE Fiscal_Year INT;
  SET Fiscal_Year = YEAR(DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL 4 MONTH));        -- Add 4 months to determine fiscal year.
  RETURN fiscal_Year
END
```

Updated query using UDF:

```sql
SELECT * FROM fact_sales_monthly 
WHERE customer_code = 90002002 
AND get_fiscal_year(date) = 2021;
```

#### Step 3: Filtering Data by Quarter

To analyze transactions by fiscal quarters, another UDF is created to determine the fiscal quarter:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION 'get_fiscal_Quarter'(calendar_date date)
  RETURNS CHAR(2)
  DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
  DECLARE m TINYINT;
  DECLARE qtr CHAR(2);
  SET m = MONTH(calendar_date);
  CASE                                                     
        when m in (9,10,11) then set qtr = "Q1";
        when m in (12,1,2)  then set qtr = "Q2";
        when m in (3,4,5)   then set qtr = "Q3" ;
        ELSE SET qtr ="Q4";
 END CASE;
RETURN qtr;
END         
```


Query to extract Q4 transactions:

```sql
SELECT * FROM fact_sales_monthly 
WHERE customer_code = 90002002 
AND get_fiscal_year(date) = 2021 
AND get_fiscal_quarter(date) = 'Q4'
ORDER BY date ASC;                         -- Filter for Q4 and sort by date.
```
---

#### Step 4: Joining Product and Sales Data

To enrich the sales data with product names and variants, I joined the fact_sales_monthly table with dim_product:

```sql
SELECT date, s.product_code, product, variant, sold_quantity
FROM fact_sales_monthly s
JOIN dim_product p ON s.product_code = p.product_code
WHERE customer_code = 90002002 
AND get_fiscal_year(s.date) = 2021 
AND get_fiscal_quarter(s.date) = 'Q4'
ORDER BY date ASC;                                 -- Add product details for Q4 transactions.
```

---

#### Step 5: Adding Gross Price

I integrated gross price data by joining the fact_sales_monthly and fact_gross_price tables, using the fiscal year for unique price lookup

```sql
SELECT date, s.product_code, product, variant, sold_quantity, gross_price
FROM fact_sales_monthly s
JOIN dim_product p ON s.product_code = p.product_code
JOIN fact_gross_price g 
ON s.product_code = g.product_code 
AND g.fiscal_year = get_fiscal_year(s.date)
WHERE customer_code = 90002002 
AND get_fiscal_year(s.date) = 2021 
AND get_fiscal_quarter(s.date) = 'Q4'
ORDER BY date ASC;                           -- Including gross price for each transaction.
```

#### Step 6: Calculating Gross Price Total

Finally, I calculated the gross price total for each transaction by multiplying the sold quantity by the gross price

```sql
SELECT date, s.product_code, product, variant, sold_quantity, gross_price,              -- Calculating and displaying gross price total for each transaction.
ROUND(sold_quantity * gross_price, 2) AS Gross_price_total
FROM fact_sales_monthly s
JOIN dim_product p ON s.product_code = p.product_code
JOIN fact_gross_price g 
ON s.product_code = g.product_code 
AND g.fiscal_year = get_fiscal_year(s.date)
WHERE customer_code = 90002002 
AND get_fiscal_year(s.date) = 2021 
AND get_fiscal_quarter(s.date) = 'Q4'
ORDER BY date ASC;
```
